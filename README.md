# MathUtils
A set of basic matrix and vector utilities and functions for the budding math student or developer.

WARNING:
This library is NOT optimized, therefore it should NOT be used in production code. That said there is little overheard and bolier plate for basic usage, making this library great for student use or on-the-fly calcuations.
